# Multi_Language
       This app supports different languages such as hindi and english(by default we will have english language).
       for supporting different languages we need to create different values folder and also need to create different mipmap folder depends on ISO codes
       
       the ISO code of Hindi Language is "hi" so will have to create values-hi folder under res folder and put string in string.xml file
